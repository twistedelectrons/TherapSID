## Building and flashing the source code:

Install `platformio`.

To compile the firmware and to generate the firmware update sysex, run:

```
make firmware.syx
```

Then put the device into bootloader mode by holding down the "filter" button while turning it on,
and send the sysex. Note that you need to wait about 200msec between each sysex.

## Unit tests

Parts of the code can be tested on your development machine. We use the
[Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) unit testing framework. To run the tests that live
in the `test/` folder, just type:

```
make test
```

Note that the tests also serve as a kind of documentation, as the section names usually give a
good hint of what the class is supposed to do.
